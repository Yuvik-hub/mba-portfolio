The LLM’s structure helped me begin drafting with clarity. I retained the layout and some phrasing, but customized the content using my real professional background, certifications, and project outcomes. The draft served as a guide, but the voice and final presentation are entirely my own.

### Commentary

The LLM provided a strong starting point for planning site structure and populating early content. I adjusted:
- The **Resume** section to reflect exact job titles and dates.
- The **Projects** page to describe real projects I completed, not hypothetical examples.
- The **Skills** list to align with certifications I hold and tools I’ve used, such as Tableau and SOP development.

I also refined the design to align with my personal aesthetic—incorporating a custom font pairing (Dancing Script + Lato), a modern light gradient theme, and accessible navigation.

The LLM helped me reduce decision fatigue and quickly structure content across pages, but all text and visuals were customized to ensure factual accuracy and personal voice.
