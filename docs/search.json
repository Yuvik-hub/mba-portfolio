The outline was particularly helpful in organizing the key sections: About, Education, Experience, Skills, Certifications, and Contact.\nHowever, I rewrote most of the section content in my own voice to ensure authenticity and accuracy. For example: - The “About Me” section in the LLM draft was too generic, so I revised it to reflect my unique cross-sector experience and specific skills. - I expanded on my professional experience with concrete accomplishments and metrics, including cost savings and compliance outcomes. - I updated the skills list to match tools and methods I’ve actually used (e.g., SOP development, Microsoft Office Suite). - I personalized the contact section and added visuals (e.g., profile photo, project image placeholders) to enhance the layout and readability.\nOverall, the LLM helped reduce writer’s block and accelerate the initial draft.
