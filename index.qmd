## Commentary

I used the LLM-generated draft as a starting point to shape the structure of my Quarto portfolio. The outline was particularly helpful in organizing the key sections: About, Education, Experience, Skills, Certifications, and Contact.

However, I rewrote most of the section content in my own voice to ensure authenticity and accuracy. For example:
- The **"About Me"** section in the LLM draft was too generic, so I revised it to reflect my unique cross-sector experience and specific skills.
- I expanded on my **professional experience** with concrete accomplishments and metrics, including cost savings and compliance outcomes.
- I updated the **skills** list to match tools and methods I’ve actually used (e.g., SOP development, Microsoft Office Suite).
- I personalized the contact section and added visuals (e.g., profile photo, project image placeholders) to enhance the layout and readability.

Overall, the LLM helped reduce writer’s block and accelerate the initial draft. All final wording is my own.
